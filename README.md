# VIROFLAY
VIROFLAY through old postcards

This is one of my first tries in using :

openstreetmap.
leaflet

The purpose is to show places in Viroflay (small french city of 15.000 inhabitants 
nearing Versailles) through some old 19th or 20th century postacards found on the Internet.

As a first try. this is a very imperfect one made with code found here and there.
